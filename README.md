A Blood Bank Management System is a great project for learning and practicing C programming. Here's a basic outline and the code structure to get you started with the project. The main goal of the system is to manage blood donors, recipients, and the inventory of blood types in a simple console-based application.

Key Features:
Donor Management - Add, update, and delete donor information.
Blood Inventory - Track different blood types (O+, O-, A+, A-, etc.).
Recipient Management - Add, update, and remove recipient details.
Search Functionality - Search donors or recipients by name or blood type.
Donor History - Track the donation history of each donor.
Data Structures:
You can use structures in C to hold information about the donors, recipients, and blood types.
